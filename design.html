            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Current T&Cs are often filled with complex legal
                language, making them difficult for anyone, especially
                older adults, to understand.</li>
              <li>•	Many elderly users experience vision problems.
                The current format of T&Cs, often lengthy and dense
                with text, can make them difficult to read.</li>
              <li>The sheer length and dry presentation of T&Cs can be disengaging,

            As a initial stage of research a literature analysis was conducted,
            to understand the reasons behind the gap between older
            adults and digital technologies which then narrowed down to
            three key concerns that can act as barriers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>The Digital Divide:</b>This refers to the lack of access, skills,
                or knowledge to effectively use digital tools and they may also face
                challenges due to limited internet connectivity, affordability of
                devices, or a lack of training opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Psychological Hurdles:</b>Beyond technical limitations, psychological
                factors can also play a role such as Fear of failure, a perceived
                lack of technical ability, or a sense of being overwhelmed by the constant
                technological advancements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Privacy Concerns:</b>Not Understanding how their data is collected
                and used can be a significant hurdle to adopting new
                technologies which leads to Data security and privacy concerns who
                are less familiar with online threats.

            From these three factors Privacy concerns has been considered as the
            major issue by most of the literature papers which was analysed and a
            survey which was named as “Senior Digital Inclusion & Security Survey”
            was conducted targeting the Indian elderly
            demographic to understand their privacy concerns, technological challenges, and their preferences.

        <p>From the survey, it has been found out that the older adults have significant
            privacy fears regarding digital technologies, including identity theft,
            data breaches, and financial loss. Despite of this either happening to
            them or hearing this news, they often neglect to read T&Cs that could
            possibly explain the future risks. Based on this, three prototypes for
            payment gateway app named Gpay, a commonly used app among participants
            (which was known by interviewing them online) using Figma. Before testing,
            a survey was again conducted to ensure that they are familiar with Gpay.
            Finally, researchers presented the prototypes to participants via WhatsApp links and Google Meet video calls.

        <p>The pilot testing stage aimed to identify and address any

            <li>
                <b>Sample Size:</b>A small group of participants was chosen for the pilot test.
                This allows for focused observation and detailed feedback on each user's interaction
                with the prototypes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Focus:</b>The primary goal was to assess usability and observed how
                participants navigated the prototypes,
                identified any confusing elements, and ensured smooth functionality
                and also to identify any issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Outcome:</b>The pilot test revealed a single issue, that the background
                color of Prototype 2 was found to be distracting and impacted the readability and based on
                the feedback it was then changed from Yellow (#FDBD00) to a more user-friendly peach (#F3CEB1).

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Sample Size:</b>With a group of fifteen participants, the updated prototypes
                were tested to know how the user experiences and perspectives regarding the T&Cs of the app.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Individual Sessions: </b>Unlike the pilot test, user testing was conducted
                individually via Google Meet. This led to
                tailor the testing experience to each participant's needs and preferences,
                leading to richer data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Data Collection:</b>During each testing session the audio was recorded instead of
                video since few of the participants were not comfortable in recording video. Analyzing
                these recordings can revealed user hesitations, thought patterns, and emotional responses
                to the prototypes, providing valuable feedback beyond what
                simple observations can captured to gain deeper insights into user behaviour and thought processes.

                After the testing the participants were asked few questions and based on those answers,
                the qualitative analysis was done using Thematic Analysis method. The questions are as follows:

                <li>What was your feeling about the length of each T&C format? </li>
                <li>Were you able to understand the information given in the T&Cs?  </li>
                <li>If you knew that our data is being used for third party service enhancement would you continue

                The quantitative analysis is done by measuring the time taken by each participant while testing and also by asking them to rate each prototype out of 5 based on readability and engagement using Likert

        <p>
            The primary objective of performing Descriptive Statistics is to get a basic
            understanding of distribution of time, engagement and readability ratings.
            The process and interpretation are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mean and Median: </b> Identities the average and middle value for the time spent,
                readability and engagement for each prototype.  </li>
            <li><b>Range and Standard Deviation:</b> Used to understand the
                spread and variability of areas.  </li> 
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This test reveals that prototype 3 has a higher mean value, indicating it
                    is the best design for users. However, it is not statistically evident that
                    prototype 2 is a good design, and Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney tests are
                    performed to test the significance.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Disengagement Despite Concerns:</b>People rarely engage with Terms & Conditions
                    (T&C) due to their length, complex language, and lack of visual appeal.
                    This surprising disconnect exists even though users’ express privacy concerns when using digital services.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Readability Matters:</b>People can’t engage with the content because of the
                    size of the content makes them feel
                    overwhelming and they feel stressed that they have to read so many while they
                    scroll the whole page and see.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Visual Influence:</b>Content which is just put up in the page without any key elements
                    to make them understand makes them feel bored and feel detached which causes the disengagement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>User Coping Mechanisms:</b>Faced with lengthy and complex T&Cs, users often develop
                    strategies to cope with the information overload. These coping mechanism indirectly creates
                    a trust on the software which makes them
                    believe that they won’t be cheated just to cross the page by accepting it and then creates a fear later.

                <li>
                    <b>Experiment Shows Positive Shift:</b>Studies demonstrate that improved T&C presentation can
                    lead to a more positive user perception of length. This could be because a well-designed T&C
                    allows users to quickly grasp the information they need, potentially increasing their
                    awareness of the information presented and making them feel more comfortable using the service.

                    among participants. The mean differences in ratings between prototypes 1 and 2 ranged from
                    1.5 to 1.8, while differences between prototypes 2 and 3 were lower, ranging from 1.2 to 1.3.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
       
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            While investigating the gap between older adults and the digital devices and technologies ,
            the study identified significant concerns about T&C complexity and lack of understanding among
            older adults, raising the question: "Why aren't people reading T&C pages?". The study found that
            lengthy, jargon-filled T&C pages contribute to older adults' avoidance of digital technologies.
            Simplifying the language, incorporating visuals, and maintaining a clear format can improve
            comprehension and engagement. However,
            the study acknowledges the limitations of a small participant pool and the need for further research.
            <br>
            <br>

            While not directly addressing the initial question of bridging the entire digital technology gap,
            this study empowers older adults to make informed decisions through improved T&C accessibility.
            They can now consciously choose whether to use a
            service based on a clear understanding of its terms, reducing reliance on avoidance due to fear and confusion.
