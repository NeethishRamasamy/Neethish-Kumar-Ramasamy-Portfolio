                    <p>Traditional educational systems often overlook the importance of plant sciences,
                        leading to a significant knowledge gap in this field. This is evidenced by alarming statistics:</p>
                    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                       <li>
                        Only 1 in 185 bioscience students graduate in botanical sciences.

                       <li>
                        In 2009, a mere 19 out of 37,000 Biological Sciences students
                        accepted Botany/Plant Science placements.

                    </ul><br>   
                    <p>This lack of engagement with plant sciences has far-reaching implications for
                        sustainability, ecological understanding, and environmental conservation.

                    indicated a significant decline in interest in botany among students, with statistics
                    showing that only 1 in 185 bioscience graduates specialized in botanical sciences.
                    Historical critiques highlighted the oversimplification
                    of botany in educational settings, further emphasizing
                    the need for innovative teaching methods.

                        Verdura prioritized selecting a VR headset that
                        could deliver an exceptional user experience while considering factors like
                        accessibility, target audience, and content compatibility. Here's a breakdown
                        of the VR headsets explored during the research phase:
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><b>Oculus Quest 2:</b>This standalone headset offers portability, a large and
                          growing library of games and applications,
                          and a user-friendly interface, making it a strong contender for Verdura.
                        </li>
                          <li><b>Valve Index:   </b> Known for its high-fidelity visuals and precise
                            tracking, the Valve Index caters to a more enthusiast audience but might
                            not be ideal for Verdura's broader target demographic due to its higher price point.
                          </li>
                          <li><b>PlayStation VR (PSVR): </b>While cost-effective and leveraging the PlayStation
                            user base, PSVR requires a PlayStation console, limiting accessibility.
                          </li>
                          <li><b>HTC Vive Cosmos Elite: </b> Offering a good balance of features and
                            ease of use, the Vive Cosmos Elite was another potential candidate.
                          </li>
                          <li><b>HP Reverb G2:</b> This high-resolution headset prioritizes visual
                            quality but might not be the most cost-effective option for Verdura.

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        A semi-structured interview process with 8 participants (aged 14-45) explored
        user experience with a VR botany
        prototype. Participants were a mix of genders (3 male, 5 female) and all
        had prior VR experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Methodology:
        </b></p>       
        <ul class="left__list">
          Moderated and exploratory approach with a mix of closed and open-ended questions.
          <br>
          <br>


        <li>Participants were briefed on the prototype content before playing it.
        </li>
        
          <li>An initial round of questioning was followed by a replay
            with video pauses at specific points to capture user feedback on visuals and understanding.
          </li>
          <br>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Key Findings:

          </b></p>       
          <ul class="left__list">
            Visual Clarity: All participants agreed that the prototype's visual clarity needed improvement, making it the top priority for future iterations.
            <br>
            <br>
  
  
          <li>Speed and Noticeability: The information presentation speed was too fast, and the green bubbles highlighting information points were not easily noticeable due to size and color.

          </li>
            
            <li>Immersion: Opinions on immersion were divided (50% positive, 50% negative).
              Interestingly, all online participants felt immersed, while none of the in-person
              participants did. This suggests potential
              influences of factors like the "bystander effect" and comfort levels in different environments.
            </li>
            <br>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Additional Feedback:

            </b></p>       
            <ul class="left__list">
              Text size and highlighting of difficult words were suggested for improved readability.

              <br>
              <br>
    
    
            <li>Users recommended including audio or text narration for guidance.

            </li>
             
              <li>VR interface improvements were noted, such as a non-floating
                side menu and missing exit controls in pop-up boxes.
              </li>
              <br>
              </ul>      
          <br>
          <p>
            Overall, the user testing yielded valuable insights to refine the
            VR botany prototype. Addressing visual clarity, information presentation speed, and user
            interface elements will be crucial in creating a more engaging and effective learning experience.
